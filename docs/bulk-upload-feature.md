# Bulk Student Upload Feature

This document provides an overview of the bulk student upload feature implementation in the Student Feedback System.

## Implementation Overview

The bulk student upload feature allows administrators to upload multiple student records at once using a CSV file. The implementation uses the following technologies:

- **PapaParse**: A powerful CSV parser for JavaScript
- **React**: For building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **Axios**: For API requests

## CSV Format Requirements

The CSV file must include the following columns:

- `name`: Student's full name
- `email`: Student's email address
- `rollNumber`: Student's roll number
- `branch`: Student's branch (department)

Example CSV format:

```csv
name,email,rollNumber,branch
John Doe,john.doe@example.com,ST12345,MCA Regular
Jane Smith,jane.smith@example.com,ST12346,MCA Regular
```

## Feature Flow

1. **File Selection**: User selects a CSV file through the file upload component
2. **Validation**: The application validates:
   - File format (must be CSV)
   - Required columns presence
   - Data completeness
   - Email format validity
3. **Preview**: First 5 rows are shown for confirmation
4. **Upload**: Data is sent to the backend API for processing
5. **Results**: Upload summary is displayed, including:
   - Total records processed
   - Successfully added students
   - Failed records with reasons

## Backend API

The backend API endpoint for bulk upload is:

```
POST /api/auth/register/bulk
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "students": [
    {
      "name": "Student Name",
      "email": "student@example.com",
      "rollNumber": "ST12345",
      "branch": "MCA Regular"
    }
    // ... more students
  ]
}
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "message": "Processed 3 students. 2 added successfully, 1 failed.",
  "results": {
    "success": 2,
    "failed": 1,
    "failures": [
      {
        "email": "invalid@example.com",
        "reason": "Missing required fields"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Default Password System

All students added through bulk upload are assigned a default password (configured in the system). Students are required to change their password upon first login.

## Error Handling

The feature includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Invalid file formats
- Missing required columns
- Empty or invalid data
- API errors
- Duplicate email addresses
- Student records that fail validation

## Testing

To test the bulk upload feature:

1. Use the template download feature to get a correctly formatted CSV
2. Add student records to the CSV
3. Upload using the interface

You can also use the `test-bulk-upload.js` script in the backend directory to test the API directly.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for additional student fields
- Implement a more advanced preview with data validation highlighting
- Add option to customize default password generation
- Add progress indicators for large file uploads
- Add export of failed records for correction and re-upload
