# User Management - Hierarchical Department/Branch/Year Selection

## 🎯 What's New

The user management system now uses a **hierarchical selection** approach:

1. **Select Department First** → Then Branch → Then Year
2. **Dynamic Filtering** - Only relevant options appear based on previous selections
3. **No Invalid Combinations** - Prevents selecting impossible combinations

## 🏗️ Department Structure

### Engineering Department

**Available Branches:**

- Computer Science (Years: 1-4)
- Electronics (Years: 1-4)
- Mechanical (Years: 1-4)
- Civil (Years: 1-4)
- Electrical (Years: 1-4)
- Information Technology (Years: 1-4)
- Chemical (Years: 1-4)
- Aerospace (Years: 1-4)
- Biotechnology (Years: 1-4)

### MCA Department

**Available Branches:**

- MCA Regular (Years: 1-2)
- MCA DS (Years: 1-2)

### MBA Department

**Available Branches:**

- MBA Finance (Years: 1-2)
- MBA Marketing (Years: 1-2)
- MBA HR (Years: 1-2)

## 🔄 How It Works

### For Students:

1. **Step 1:** Select Department (Engineering/MCA/MBA)
2. **Step 2:** Select Branch (filtered by department)
3. **Step 3:** Select Year (filtered by department + branch)
4. **Step 4:** Enter Roll Number

### For Faculty/HOD:

1. **Step 1:** Select Department
2. **Step 2:** Select Specialization/Branch

## 🎨 User Experience

### Dynamic Behavior:

- **Department Change** → Resets Branch and Year
- **Branch Change** → Resets Year
- **Progressive Disclosure** → Fields appear only when needed

### Visual Feedback:

- ✅ Only valid options are shown
- 🔄 Form resets appropriately when selections change
- 📋 Clear labels for each step

## 💾 Database Schema Updates

### New User Model Fields:

```javascript
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  role: String,
  department: String,  // ← NEW: 'Engineering', 'MCA', 'MBA'
  branch: String,      // ← Updated with more options
  year: Number,        // ← 1-4 based on department/branch
  rollNumber: String,  // ← Admin-entered value
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 🔍 Example Flow

### Creating an Engineering Student:

1. **Department:** Engineering
2. **Branch:** Computer Science _(only Engineering branches shown)_
3. **Year:** 2nd Year _(1-4 options available)_
4. **Roll Number:** 21CS001 _(admin enters)_

### Creating an MCA Student:

1. **Department:** MCA
2. **Branch:** MCA Regular _(only MCA branches shown)_
3. **Year:** 1st Year _(only 1-2 options available)_
4. **Roll Number:** 23MCA001 _(admin enters)_

## ✅ Benefits

### For Administrators:

- **No Invalid Data** - Can't create impossible combinations
- **Faster Input** - Guided selection process
- **Consistent Data** - All students follow same structure

### For System:

- **Data Integrity** - Proper relationships maintained
- **Easier Filtering** - Subject assignment becomes cleaner
- **Scalable** - Easy to add new departments/branches

### For Students:

- **Accurate Subjects** - Get exactly their department's subjects
- **Proper Filtering** - See only relevant courses
- **Better Experience** - No confusion about their branch

## 🚀 Testing the New System

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Create Engineering Student** - Select dept → branch → year
2. **Create MCA Student** - Notice limited year options
3. **Create Faculty** - Select dept → specialization
4. **Edit Existing User** - Form loads with proper hierarchy

### Expected Behavior:

- ✅ Branch dropdown updates when department changes
- ✅ Year dropdown updates when branch changes
- ✅ Form validates properly before submission
- ✅ Backend stores all fields correctly

This hierarchical approach ensures data consistency and provides a much better user experience for administrators managing the system! 🎯
